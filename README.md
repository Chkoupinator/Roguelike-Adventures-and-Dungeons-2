# **Features:**

Roguelike Adventures and Dungeons 2 is an official spiritual successor of well-known Roguelike Adventures and Dungeons modpack inspired by many RPG, roguelike, roguelite and dungeon-delving games and modpacks. It's an exploration based modpack with over 250 mods, 100+ new biomes, 12+ dimensions and dozens of new dungeons to delve and loot, ground or flying structures to find and bosses to fight. Level up skills; find new better equipment, relics or trinkets; build and decorate your base and go exploring to find a lot of new interesting! Everyone can find something for themselves in this modpack.
Progressive difficulty and scaling mobs with different attributes forces you to always be in shape in terms of equipment and skill. There are also a lot of option to gain more health to compensate.

Modpack encourages many different playstyles like

‚úîÔ∏è questing - over 1500 quests with useful rewards and shop;

‚úîÔ∏è exploration - 100+ biomes, dozens of structures, dungeons and dimensions;

‚úîÔ∏è nomadism - pocket dimensions, backpacks, bags, portable homes;
